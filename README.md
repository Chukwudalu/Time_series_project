# Time_series_project
A time series project .

This is a project for analyzing and predicting the crime rate in Chicago for the next one year. The data source can be found in the jupyter note book. 
From the analysis, we could see the trends and the periods where crimes tend to be high and when they tend to be low.
I made predictions using FbProphet.
